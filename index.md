# Navid Boloorian
![The man himself](navid-face.png)
He is the ~~coolest~~ **snazziest** guy named Navid Boloorian within a one mile radius of *wherever* he happens to be located at any given time.

How snazzy is he? Some people say:
>very

Apart from his snazziness, Navid is a programmer that is well-versed in the world of web design. Experienced with React, HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, PHP (gasp), and SQL, he feels confident when tackling any task ahead of him.

Here is a little snippet of some of his greatest work:
'''
console.log("Hello world");
'''


When he finishes up with web design, Navid hopes to move onto augmented reality. He dreams of a world with state-of-the-art AR glasses that, instead of taking away from reality like phones do, enhance it. Killer tagline: "[insert AR company name]: **_enhance reality_**." He asks that you do not steal that.

With everyone adopting his glasses, Navid's goals are to:
- [ ] Achieve world domination
- [ ] A second thing

#### Interests

Although he loves programming, Navid finds his true passion through stand up comedy. So far his career is going[...](#terribly)

Always keeping up with current events, Navid can be found browsing the latest, earth-shattering news from [the most reliable sources](https://www.theonion.com/).

He's not a movie buff but he does assert with conviction that the [death of Mongo in Shrek 2](mongo-face.jpg) is the saddest moment of the entire western canon.

A huge basketball fan, Navid projects the final standings for the 2022-23 NBA eastern conference to play out as follows (he is adamant that this list is purely objective):
1. Cleveland Cavaliers
2. Other, inferior team
3. Other, inferior team
4. Other, inferior team
5. Other, inferior team
6. Other, inferior team
7. Other, inferior team
8. Other, inferior team
9. Other, inferior team
10. Other, inferior team
11. Other, inferior team
12. Other, inferior team
13. Other, inferior team
14. Other, inferior team
15. Other, inferior team

Navid fears:
- Heights
- Death
- The C programming language
- Fear itself (a contentious disagreement with Franklin Delano Roosevelt who believes this is the only thing to fear. As a result, he and Navid have not spoken since April 12, 1945)

## Terribly
### He should definitely keep his day job
